Add a content block to the homepage
===================================

Goal
----

Our homepage still lacks the possibility to manage different kinds of 
content blocks. E.g. a text with floating image, a image gallery or quote.

Steps
-----

* Add a new block `blocks` to `config/templates/pages/homepage.xml`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Modify the "Homepage", add some blocks
* Output the blocks in `templates/pages/homepage.html.twig`
