Add a content block to the homepage
===================================

Goal
----

Currently our homepage is composed of one big text editor and lacks the possibility 
to manage different kinds of content blocks. E.g. text with floating image, an image 
gallery or quote. We want a flexible way to manage this kind of content blocks without 
worrying about that a content manager breaking the site.

Steps
-----

* Add a new block `blocks` to `config/templates/pages/homepage.xml` with more than one block type
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Modify the "Homepage" and add some content blocks
* Output the blocks in `templates/pages/homepage.html.twig`

Hints
-----

Run `bin/console sulu:content:types:dump` to get a list of all the available content types.
