Add a content block to the homepage
===================================

Goal
----

Currently the content of our homepage consists of a single text editor and therefore lacks the possibility 
of managing different kinds of standardized content sections. We want to provide a way to manage content 
block such as image galleries or quotes to our content manager without having to worry about breaking the layout of our page.

Steps
-----

* Add a new block with multiply types and the name `blocks` to the `config/templates/pages/homepage.xml` file
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Modify the "Homepage" and add some content blocks
* Render the created blocks in your `templates/pages/homepage.html.twig`

Hints
-----

Run `bin/console sulu:content:types:dump` to list all available content types.

More Information
----------------

The block content type allows to define an arbitrary amount of block types. Each block type
is a composition of multiple basic content types. After defining a block content type, the content manager
is able to create and sort instances of the configured block types in the Sulu administration interface.

A common use case for the block content type is to group a text editor and a media selection. 
This allows to couple the respective text to the selected image and render it in a flexible and responsive way on your website.
In contrast, adding images to a basic text editor makes it harder to adapt the format and placement in your twig template.
