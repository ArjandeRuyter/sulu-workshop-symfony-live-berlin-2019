Add a footer navigation to the website
======================================

Goal
----

Currently our website has only a static footer section. As content manager I want 
to be able to manage the linked pages in the footer by myself. 

Steps
-----

* Add a new navigation-context `footer` to `config/webspaces/example.xml`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Create a new page and add the page to the footer navigation in the settings tab
* Output the new navigation in `templates/base.html.twig`

Hints
-----

* Have a look at the already existing `main` navigation

More Information
----------------

In Sulu itâ€™s possible to define so called navigation contexts, which allows the user to add pages 
to different kind of navigations. The different contexts can be defined in the webspace configuration 
file in the navigation-section. This selections will be available to choose from in the administration interface. 

Afterwards the developer can retrieve the navigation for a given context by using some Twig-extensions 
delivered with Sulu, whereby it is not only possible to retrieve a flat list of pages, but also to retrieve 
entire navigation trees.
