Add a footer navigation to the website
======================================

Goal
----

Right now, our website displays a static footer section on every page. We want to provide a way to manually manage 
the links displayed in our footer section to our content manager.

Steps
-----

* Add a new navigation-context `footer` to the `config/webspaces/example.xml` file
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Create a new page and add the page to the footer navigation via the settings tab
* Output the new `footer` navigation in your `templates/base.html.twig`

Hints
-----

* Have a look at the existing `main` navigation-context

More Information
----------------

Sulu allows to define multiple so called navigation contexts to which the content manager can add an arbitrary number 
of pages. Navigation contexts are defined in the navigation-section of the webspace configuration and can be assigned 
to a page via the settings tab in the administration interface. 

After defining a navigation context, a developer can retrieve the navigation for a given context by using Twig 
extensions delivered with Sulu. The provided Twig extensions allow to retrieve a flat list of pages or a complete 
nested navigation tree.
