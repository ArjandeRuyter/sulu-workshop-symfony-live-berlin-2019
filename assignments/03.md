Add a footer navigation to the website
======================================

Goal
----

Currently our website has only a static footer section. As content manager I want 
to be able to manage the linked pages in the footer by myself. 

Steps
-----

* Add a new navigation-context `footer` to `config/webspaces/example.xml`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Create a new page and add the page to the footer navigation in the settings tab
* Output the new navigation in `templates/base.html.twig`
