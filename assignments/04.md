More Information
----------------

Sulu is built for companies with an international focus, translating pages into multiple different 
languages is a very important task for a content editor using Sulu. Sulu also considers the different 
variations of a language among different countries. The combination of these two factors is called a localization.

Localizations for the content are configured in the webspace configuration file.
