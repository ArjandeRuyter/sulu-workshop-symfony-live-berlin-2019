Add additional languages to the website
=======================================

Goal
----

Our website is gaining traction in germany and france. To communicate with our new users in their native language, 
we want to add german an french as additional languages and translate our existing content.

Steps
-----

* Add the new languages to the `config/webspaces/example.xml` file
* Run `bin/console sulu:document:initialize` to initialize the new languages
* Change the url configuration in the same file
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Give the admin user permissions for the new languages
* Add content in the new languages
* Implement a language switcher in your `templates/base.html.twig`

Hints
-----

* Use `{{ dump(urls) }}` in the Twig template to find out how Sulu provides urls for multiple languages

More Information
----------------

As Sulu is built for internationally focused companies, managing localized content is a core feature of the system. 
Sulu does not only handle different languages, but also allows to manage different variations of a single language 
among different countries. Such a variation is called localization.

Available localizations for the content of the website are defined in the webspace configuration file.
