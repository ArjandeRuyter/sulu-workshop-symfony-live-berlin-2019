Add a page template `Event` overview ot the website 
===================================================

Goal
----

Our website is lacking an overview of all events. We would love to 
have a separate page which displays all the events we are managing.

Steps
-----

* Create a new template in `config/templates/pages/event_overview.xml` and `templates/pages/event_overview.html.twig`
* Add a property `events` with type `smart_content` and provider `event`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Create a new page `Events` and select the template `event_overview`
* Select the navigation context `main`
* Output the events in `templates/pages/event_overview.html.twig`

Hints
-----

* Use `{{ dump(content.events) }}` in the Twig template to find out how to output the events overview

More Information
----------------

The smart content is one of our most powerful content types. It allows the content editor to dynamically 
configure an aggregation of content, whereby content does not only mean pages. This is possible due to the 
data providers, which can be registered in the system. A data provider defines which options are supported, 
and is responsible for loading the data. 

Sulu is already shipped with different data providers, one for pages from the content management section, 
and another two for contacts, accounts and media.
