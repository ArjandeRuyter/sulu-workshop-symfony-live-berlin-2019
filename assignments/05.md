Add a page template `Event` overview ot the website 
===================================================

Goal
----

Our website is lacking an overview of all events. We would love to 
have a separate page which displays all the events we are managing.

Steps
-----

* Create a new template in `config/templates/pages/event_overview.xml` and `templates/pages/event_overview.html.twig`
* Add a property `events` with type `smart_content` and provider `event`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Create a new page `Events` and select the template `event_overview`
* Select the navigation context `main`
* Output the events in `templates/pages/event_overview.html.twig`
