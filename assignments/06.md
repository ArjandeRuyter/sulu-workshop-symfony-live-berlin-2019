Add an event registration to the website
========================================

Goal
----

In the future it should be possible to register for events. We need a register form
with email address, first- and last name on each event detail page.

Steps
-----

* Follow symfony best practice and add a new entity `EventRegistration`
* Add a many-to-one relation targeting `Event` in the newly created entity
* Don't forget to run `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:update --force`
* Follow symfony best-practice to add a new form type
* Add the code to submit the form data in `src/Controller/EventWebsiteController.php`
* Output form and success in `templates/events/index.html.twig`
* Brows a event and register for it

Hints
-----

* Use `bin/adminconsole make:entity EventRegistration`
* https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#creating-an-entity-class
* Use `bin/adminconsole make:form EventType Event` 
* https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices/forms.html
* Run `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:validate`
