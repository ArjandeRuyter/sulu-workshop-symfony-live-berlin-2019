Allow for event registration on the website
===========================================

Goal
----

We want to allow our users to register themselves for our events in the future. Therefore we need to display a 
register form that includes input fields for a email address, a first and last name on each event detail page.

Steps
-----

* Follow the symfony best practices to add a new `EventRegistration` entity
* Add a many-to-one association between the `Event` entity and your newly created `EventRegistration` entity
* Don't forget to update your database schema with `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:update --force`
* Follow the symfony best practices to add a new `EventRegistration` form type
* Persist submitted registrations in your `src/Controller/EventWebsiteController.php`
* Output your form and a success message in your `templates/events/index.html.twig`
* Browse one of your events and register yourself

Hints
-----

* Use `bin/adminconsole make:entity EventRegistration`
* https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#creating-an-entity-class
* Use `bin/adminconsole make:form EventType Event` 
* https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices/forms.html
* Run `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:validate`
