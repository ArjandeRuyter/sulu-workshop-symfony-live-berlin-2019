Display the registrations for each event in the admin interface 
===============================================================

Goal
----

Our event managers need to keep track on all the incoming registrations. It would 
be nice to have a list view of all the registrations for each event in the admin interface.

Steps
-----

* Create a new Api-Controller `EventRegistrationController` to query event-registrations
* Add a new list configuration for `event_registrations`
* Configure a new resource `event_registrations` in `config/packages/app_admin.yaml`
* Add a new admin route in `src/Admin/AppAdmin` by using the `ListRouteBuilder`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Go to the event you selected in the assignment before and see your values
