Display the registrations for each event in the admin interface 
===============================================================

Goal
----

Our event managers need to keep track on all the incoming registrations. It would 
be nice to have a list view of all the registrations for each event in the admin interface.

Steps
-----

* Create a new admin Api-Controller `App\Controller\Admin\EventRegistrationController` to query event-registrations
* Register the controller in `config/routes_admin.yaml`
* Configure a new resource `event_registrations` in `config/packages/sulu_admin.yaml`
* Add a new list configuration for `event_registrations` in `config/lists/event_registrations.xml`
* Add a new admin route in `src/Admin/EventAdmin` by using the `ListRouteBuilder`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Go to the event you selected in the assignment before and see your values

Hints
-----

* Have a look at the event admin Api-Controller `App\Controller\Admin\EventController`
* Have a look at the existing event list configuration `config/lists/events.xml`
* Have a look at the existing admin-routes for the event in `src/Admin/AppAdmin`

More Information
----------------

The administration interface is implemented as single-page application written in React which requires a 
standardized REST API for loading and manipulating the different resources available in the system.
For custom entities you need to implement the REST endpoint by yourself.

Passing REST API URLs in configs directly to the JS part of our admin would be a pain, because they have to 
be used in a few places. Therefore we introduced the concept of resources, which abstracts the API URLs 
for list and detail behind a resourceKey, which can in turn then be used in other configurations.

For rendering lists and forms in the administration interface we use metadata which are written in XML.

Admin Routes are the path of the route being used in the admin frontend application. The JS application is 
using URL fragments (the ones with the hash) to display and recognize them.
