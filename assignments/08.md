Add a custom entity `Location`
==============================

Goal
----

We are managing more and more events that take place at the same location. Because our content managers do not want 
to enter the same location information over and over again we would like to provide a central place for managing the 
locations of our events.

As this task is quite complex, we are going to break down the requirements into smaller pieces and multiple 
assignments. In this assignment, we want to add a new `Location` entity to our database model.

Steps
-----

* Follow the symfony best practices to add a `Location` entity with the following properties:
  * `name`
  * `street`
  * `city`
  * `countryCode`
* Don't forget to run `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:update --force`

Hints
-----

* Use `bin/adminconsole make:entity Location`
* https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#creating-an-entity-class
* Run `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:validate`

This assignment is purely based on Symfony. No Sulu knowledge required ;-)
