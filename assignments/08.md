Add a custom entity `Location`
==============================

Goal
----

We are managing more and more events which take place at the same location. 
To reduce the effort of adding the same location information over and over again 
we want to have a central place to manage locations.

This is not an easy task and because of that we are going to break down 
the requirements into smaller pieces.

First at all we want to update the database model and add a new custom entity `Location`. 

Steps
-----

Steps for 08+09

* Follow symfony best practice and add a new entity `Location`
* Create a new Api-Controller `LocationController` to query locations
* Add a new  list configuration for `event_registrations
* Configure a new resource `locations` in `config/packages/app_admin.yaml`
* Add a new admin route in `src/Admin/AppAdmin` by using the `ListRouteBuilder`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Goto the list of locations and see nothing :)
