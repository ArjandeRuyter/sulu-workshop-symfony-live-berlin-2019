Add a custom entity `Location`
==============================

Goal
----

We are managing more and more events which take place at the same location. 
To reduce the effort of adding the same location information over and over again 
we want to have a central place to manage locations.

This is not an easy task and because of that we are going to break down 
the requirements into smaller pieces.

First at all we want to update the database model and add a new custom entity `Location`. 

Steps
-----

* Follow symfony best practice and add a new entity `Location` with new properties e.g.:
  * `name`
  * `street`
  * `city`
  * `countryCode`
  * ...
* Don't forget to run `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:update --force`

Hints
-----

* Use `bin/adminconsole make:entity Location`
* https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#creating-an-entity-class
* Run `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:validate`

More Information

Symfony only ;-)
