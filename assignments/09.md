Display location list in the admin interface
============================================

Goal
----

After adding the `Location` entity in the last assignment, we want to add a new navigation item to the Sulu 
administration interface that allows to access a list of all managed locations.

Steps
-----

* Create a new admin API-Controller `App\Controller\Admin\LocationController` with a `cgetAction` to that returns 
 our locations
* Register the controller in your `config/routes_admin.yaml`
* Configure a new resource `locations` in your `config/packages/sulu_admin.yaml`
* Add a new list configuration for `locations` in a `config/lists/locations.xml` file
* Create a new Admin class `src/Admin/LocationAdmin.php`
* Configure a new admin navigation item in your `src/Admin/LocationAdmin.php`
* Use the `ListRouteBuilder` to add a new admin route in your `src/Admin/LocationAdmin.php`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Goto the list of locations and see an empty list :)

Hints
-----

* Have a look at the existing event navigation item in the `src/Admin/EventAdmin.php` file
