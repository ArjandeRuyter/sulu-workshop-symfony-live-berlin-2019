Add a list representation for locations in the admin interface
==============================================================

Goal
----

Adding a new navigation point and list representation for locations within the admin interface 
is our next challenge.

Steps
-----

* Create a new admin Api-Controller `App\Controller\Admin\LocationController` to query locations
* Register the controller in `config/routes_admin.yaml`
* Add a new list configuration for `locations` in `config/lists/locations.xml`
* Configure a new resource `locations` in `config/packages/sulu_admin.yaml`
* Add a new admin navigation item in `src/Admin/LocationAdmin`
* Add a new admin route in `src/Admin/LocationAdmin` by using the `ListRouteBuilder`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Goto the list of locations and see nothing :)

Hints
-----

* Have a look at the existing event admin navigation item in `src/Admin/AppAdmin`
