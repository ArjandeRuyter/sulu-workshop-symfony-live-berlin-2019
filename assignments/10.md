Add a form to add, edit or delete locations in the admin interface
==================================================================

Goal
----

We have already added a list that display existing locations in the last assignment. To complete our location 
management functionality, we want to implement a form that allows to add, edit and delete locations via the Sulu 
administration interface.

Steps
-----

* Add the logic for adding, modifying and deleting locations to your `App\Controller\Admin\LocationController`
* Configure the detail route for the `locations` resource in your `config/packages/sulu_admin.yaml`
* Add a form-configuration for `location_details` in a `config/forms/location_details.xml` file
* Add admin routes for adding and editing locations in your `src\Admin\LocationAdmin`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Navigate to the locations list and add a new location

Hints
-----

* Have a look at the admin API-Controller `App\Controller\Admin\EventController` for the Event entity
* Have a look at the existing admin-routes for the Event entity in `src/Admin/AppAdmin.php` file

Have a look at assignment 07 for more information.
