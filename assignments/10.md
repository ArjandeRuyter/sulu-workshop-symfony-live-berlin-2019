Add a form to add, edit or delete locations in the admin interface
==================================================================

Goal
----

The last missing piece for our location management is a form to add, edit or delete locations.  

Steps
-----

* Add logic to add, modify and delete to the `App\Controller\Admin\LocationController`
* Configure the detail route for the `locations` resource in `config/packages/sulu_admin.yaml`
* Add a form-configuration for `location_details` form in `config/forms/location_details.xml`
* Add admin-routes to add and edit locations in `src\Admin\AppAdmin`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Goto the locations list and add new locations

Hints
-----

* Have a look at the event admin Api-Controller `App\Controller\Admin\EventController`
* Have a look at the existing admin-routes for the event in `src/Admin/AppAdmin`
