Add a association between events and locations
==============================================

Goal
----

After implementing the location management functionality in the Sulu administration interface, we want to add an 
association between the `Event` entity and the `Location` entity. With this assignment we are completing our goal of 
removing redundant location information inside of different events.

Steps
-----

* Add a many-to-one association between the `Event` entity and the `Location` entity
* Don't forget to update your database schema with `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:update --force`
* Serialize the id of the associated location of an event as `locationId` (will be used in the controller afterwards)
* Add the logic for setting and modifying the `locationId` property in your `src/Controller/EventController.php`
* Configure a new `single_location_selection` field type in your `config/packages/sulu_admin.yaml`
* Add a property `locationId` with the type `single_location_selection` to your `event_details` form
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Navigate to an event and select one of your locations

Hints
-----

* Run `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:validate`
* Run `bin/adminconsole debug:config sulu_admin field_type_options.single_selection` to get some insights on how to
 configure a single selection field type.

More Information
----------------

If you want to select a custom entity somewhere in your form, you need to use a respective field type for this 
property. To simplify this process for the developer, Sulu includes an abstract `selection` and `single_selection` 
field type. These abstract field types can be instantiated for your custom entity by providing respective 
`field_type_options` in the configuration of your application.
