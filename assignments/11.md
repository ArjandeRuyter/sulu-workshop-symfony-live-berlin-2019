Add a relation between events and locations
===========================================

Goal
----

Now it's time to add a relation between events and locations. With this task we are 
completing our initial goal to remove all redundant location information for the different events.

Steps
-----

* Add a many-to-one relation named `location` to the `Event` entity
* Add the `locationId` to serialization (will be used afterwards in the controller)
* Add the logic to set and modify the `locationId` property in `src/Controller/EventController`
* Configure `single_location_selection` in `config/packages/sulu_admin.yaml`
* Add a property `locationId` with the type `single_location_selection` to `event_details` form
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Goto to a event and select a location
