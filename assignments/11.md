Add a relation between events and locations
===========================================

Goal
----

Now it's time to add a relation between events and locations. With this task we are 
completing our initial goal to remove all redundant location information for the different events.

Steps
-----

* Add a many-to-one relation named `location` to the `Event` entity
* Don't forget to run `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:update --force`
* Add the a virtual property `locationId` to serialization (field type only works with IDs)
* Add the logic to set and modify the `locationId` property in `src/Controller/EventController`
* Configure `single_location_selection` in `config/packages/sulu_admin.yaml`
* Add a property `locationId` with the type `single_location_selection` to `event_details` form
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Goto to a event and select a location

Hints
-----

* Run `bin/adminconsole doctrine:schema:validate`
* Run `bin/adminconsole debug:config sulu_admin field_type_options.single_selection` to get some insights 
on how to configure a single selection field type.

More Information
----------------

There are some field types which make sense for many different entities. E.g. a selection field 
in the form makes sense for most entities. Therefore field type configurations have been introduced, 
which allow to offer abstract field types. Based on this abstract field types it is possible to add 
concrete implementations for custom entities by only adding a few lines of configuration.
