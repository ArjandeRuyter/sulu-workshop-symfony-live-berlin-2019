Add a location filter to the events overview page
=================================================

Goal
----

Based on the normalized locations we are now able to provide a location filter on our event overview page.

Steps
-----

* Create a custom content controller `EventOverviewController`
* Remove property `events` from `event_overview` and use the newly created controller
* Use the `EventRepository` to load events in `EventOverviewController`
* Use the `LocationRepository` to load locations in `EventOverviewController`
* Add the locations and events to the twig-rendering
* Render a form with a location-dropdown in `templates/events/index.html.twig`
* Add a `filterByLocationId` method to the `EventRepository` and use the value in the controller to call this method
