Add a location filter to the events overview page
=================================================

Goal
----

After adding an association between our `Location` entity and our `Event` entity in the last assignment, we can
now easily query events for a specific location. We want to make use of this by adding a location filter to the
events overview page of our website.

Steps
-----

* Create a new content controller `App\Controller\EventOverviewController`
* Remove the `events` property from the `event_overview` template
* Use the newly created `App\Controller\EventOverviewController` in your `event_overview` template
* Use the `EventRepository` to load events in your `EventOverviewController`
* Use the `LocationRepository` to load locations in your `EventOverviewController`
* Pass the loaded locations and events to your Twig template
* Render a form with a location dropdown in your `templates/events/index.html.twig`
* Add a `filterByLocationId` method to your `App\Repository\EventRepository`
* Call the `filterByLocationId` method with the submitted value in your `EventOverviewController`
